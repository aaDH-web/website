The Australasian Association for Digital Humanities Inc (aaDH) was formed in March 2011 to strengthen the digital humanities research community in Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and the Pacific and is a member of the international [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations (ADHO)](https://adho.org/).

The professional association acts to support and extend links between digital humanities researchers, improve professional development opportunities and provide international leverage for local projects and initiatives. aaDH organises the Digital Humanities Australasia [conference](https://aa-dh.org/conferences/) every two years and provides a range of other opportunities for fostering understanding of digital technologies in the humanities.

We invite you to [join](https://aa-dh.org/join/) our community by becoming a member of the association.
