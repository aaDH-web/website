Note that subscriptions are denominated in British pounds, Euros, or US dollars.

Once you become a member you will be emailed an OUP 'customer' number, which doubles as your aaDH 'subscriber' number. This number must be quoted to receive membership discounts including discounted registration rates at international DH and aaDH conferences.

Note that subscribers are asked to select which ADHO association they wish to join. Scroll down the page and select the option to join the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities.

Your subscription is invaluable to the association.
