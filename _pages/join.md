All membership administration is managed by Oxford University Press.

Members may choose the 'membership only' option (AUD$50 approx) or elect to also subscribe to the journal [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh) which is published on behalf of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/external.html?link=http://adho.org/) (ADHO).

Note that subscriptions are made in British pounds, Euros or US dollars.

Once you become a member you will be emailed an OUP 'customer' number, which doubles as your aaDH 'subscriber' number. This must be quoted to receive membership discounts including substantially discounted registration rates at international DH and aaDH conferences.

Note that subscribers are asked to select which ADHO association they wish to belong to. Scroll down the page to find the option to subscribe to the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities.

Your subscription is invaluable to the association.
