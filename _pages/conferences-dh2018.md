## The Australasian Association for Digital Humanities (aaDH) is pleased to announce its fourth conference, to be held at the University of South Australia in Adelaide on 25-28 September 2018.

The aim of DHA 2018 is to advance and critically assess the uses of digital technologies in humanities research and the communication of its outcomes. The conference offers a supportive, interdisciplinary environment to explore the challenges and opportunities of working with digital tools and techniques.

The conference will explore how the Digital Humanities enhance our ability to make connections between disciplines, sectors, countries, ways of thinking, people and possibilities. Sessions will focus on praxis and innovation across the international scene, with emphasis on local and regional communities of practice in Australasia and the Pacific. Together, delegates will explore how academics can use data and digital tools to tackle real world challenges in partnership with collecting organisations, industry, government and communities.

Keynotes, papers and workshops will investigate the living relationship between teaching, research, curation, creation, production, exhibition and distribution, exploring the link between digital humanities, creative industries and digital disruption more broadly. Conference dialogue will explore new problems in the worlds of education, employment, research and development, identifying new ideas, tools and methods. Workshops will unpack new approaches to problem solving and new ways of linking infrastructure, collections, users and spaces.

We will also consider Humanities education (in formal and informal settings) that employs digital, collaborative, project-based learning, including learning that may operate at the intersection of the academy, the community and GLAM sectors. Specific pedagogic tools considered may include: virtual and augmented reality; immersive and interactive experiences and games; open platforms, social media, networks; and data analytics.

The conference is supported by the Division of Education, Arts and Social Sciences at the University of South Australia, eRSA, AusStage and Flinders University of South Australia.

Submissions may feature projects or case studies ranging from research and teaching to creative practice, community outreach and problem solving.

Collaborative and multi-partner submissions are particularly welcomed in all categories.

The conference seeks proposals for lightning talks, papers, birds of a feather sessions, workshops and posters.
