The [Australian Academy of the Humanities](https://humanities.org.au/) advances knowledge of, and the pursuit of excellence in, the humanities in Australia for the benefit of the nation. Established by Royal Charter in 1969, the Academy is constituted by a body of more than 500 elected Fellows who are leaders and experts in the broad disciplinary groups which share a common and central concern with human behaviour and culture including: Archaeology; Asian Studies; Classical Studies; Cultural and Communication Studies; English; European Languages and Cultures; History; Linguistics; Philosophy and the History of Ideas; Religion; and The Arts. The Academy embraces new and emerging fields in the humanities. It also promotes the crucial role of the humanities in interdisciplinary collaboration, for the key challenges and opportunities facing Australia in the twenty-first century are not merely technical or economic in nature, but are deeply embedded in our society and culture.
