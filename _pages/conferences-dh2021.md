The fifth biennial DHA conference of the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities (aaDH) was held in November 2021 (virtual / on-line only). It was the first aaDH conference hosted in Aotearoa New Zealand. Organised by a consortium of three NZ Universities, it was run primarily by University of Canterbury Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha in Ōtautahi Christchurch.
