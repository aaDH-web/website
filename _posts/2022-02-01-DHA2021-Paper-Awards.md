The 2021 Digital Humanities Australia conference, the biennial conference of the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities, was hosted by Canterbury University with the theme 'Ka Renarena Te Taukaea \| Creating Communities'.

**Caelum Greaves, Ursula Standring Bellugue, Chris Lam** from Otago University was Highly Commended for their panel 'What are literary games, and why do they matter?'. The conference committee valued the panel's originality, creativity and high quality presentations.
