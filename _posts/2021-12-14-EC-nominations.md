A message from Simon Musgrave, aaDH Secretary:

The terms of several members of the aaDH Executive Committee are concluding.

aaDH President Professor Paul Millar announced his decision to step down at the end of the 2021 DHA conference with one year left of his term, and the role has been filled by Associate Professor Rachel Hendery.  The committee thanks Paul Millar for his service to the association.

The Executive Committee, as specified in the Rules of the association, consists of nine members, with the possibility of additional members being co-opted. Such an appointment had been in place, but at this election we will return to the nine-member model.

There are currently six vacancies to be filled with terms starting in 2022:

* Vice-President (3 years, 2022-24)
* Communications Manager (3 years, 2022-24)
* Treasurer (2 years, 2022-23)
* 1 x Ordinary Member (3 years, 2022-24)
* 2 x Ordinary Members (2 years, 2022-23)

Nominations for these positions are now open.

The Rules of the association relevant to this process are:

> 25 Election of officers and ordinary members of the committee
> 
> 25.1 To be considered valid, nominations of candidates for election as officers of the association or as ordinary members of the committee must be
> 
> 25.1.1 made to the secretary by electronic transmission; and
> 
> 25.1.2 transmitted to the secretary not less than 7 days before the date fixed for the holding of the annual elections; and
> 
> 25.1.3 endorsed by at least one current officer of the association or ordinary member of the committee.
> 
> 25.2 A candidate may nominate for one or more vacant positions on the committee.
> 
> 25.3 If insufficient nominations are received to fill all vacancies on the committee, the candidates nominated will be deemed to be elected and further nominations may > be received at the annual general meeting.
> 
> 25.4 If the number of nominations received is equal to the number of vacancies to be filled, the persons nominated shall be deemed to be elected.
> 
> 25.5 If the number of nominations exceeds the number of vacancies to be filled, a ballot must be held.

In relation to rule 25.1.3, I will endorse the nomination of any member in good standing (in the absence of endorsement from another committee member).

In relation to rule 25.5, if a ballot is necessary, it will be run electronically by OUP. To vote in such an election, it is necessary to be a member of the association in good standing (i.e. a financial member).

Although rule 25.1.2 allows for nominations up to 7 days before the election date, it would greatly assist OUP to have details of as many nominees as possible earlier than that date. In addition to sending your formal nomination to me, please also send a short candidate's statement (c150 words) which will be made available online. 

The election will take place between January 31 2022 and February 4 2022; members eligible to vote will receive details from OUP before the election opens. Prospective candidates are welcome to contact Simon Musgrave or Tully Barnett(aaDH communications manager) at any time.
